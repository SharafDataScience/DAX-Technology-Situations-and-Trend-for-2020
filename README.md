## Executive Summary
- Data sourced from GitHub Jobs API, web scraping, and Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019.
- Applied data wrangling techniques to clean and standardize data.
- Analyzed technology trends using Python and IBM Cognos.
- Generated insights into future programming and database usage.

## Introduction
The tech industry is evolving rapidly, making it critical to monitor changes in language and database preferences. This project provides data-driven insights using surveys and job posting trends.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: GitHub API, Web scraping, Stack Overflow Survey.
- **Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values.
- **Normalization**: Standardized compensation data.
- **EDA**: Distribution analysis, correlation checks, and outlier detection.

## Results
- Visualizations of compensation and age distributions.
- Boxplots for demographic insight.
- Bar charts showing technology usage and shifts.

## Trends

### Programming Languages
- Python maintained and increased its popularity.
- TypeScript entered top 5, replacing Bash/Shell/PowerShell.
- Trend shift suggests growing interest in niche/non-top-5 languages.

### Databases
- SQL databases declined in top positions.
- NoSQL and cloud-based databases like Redis and Elasticsearch gained traction.

## Discussion
The power of a programming language lies in its alignment with developer skill and project requirements. The insights from this project help inform hiring, learning, and development decisions.

## Conclusion
- Pythonâ€™s simplicity and community support make it increasingly dominant.
- NoSQL and cloud DBs are rising due to scalability and flexibility.
- Windows and Linux remain key development platforms.
- Need for more gender balance and developer support in the industry.
